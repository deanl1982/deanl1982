# Hi, I'm Dean 👋

### 🚀 Enterprise Architect & Technology Leader

I’m an Enterprise Architect and Technology Leader with over 20 years’ experience driving cloud transformation, digital modernisation, and enterprise architecture at scale. I specialise in Microsoft 365, Azure, Identity & Security, and Automation, leading teams that turn strategy into tangible business outcomes.

As an Enterprise Architect, I lead the architecture and transformation of NHS.net Connect (formerly NHSmail) — the UK’s largest healthcare collaboration platform and Microsoft’s largest Entra ID tenant, supporting 1.8 million healthcare professionals.

My role bridges Enterprise, Solution, and Technical Architecture, combining strategic foresight with deep technical execution. I’m currently leading the adoption of Generative AI and intelligent agents and authoring governance standards to guide the safe, ethical, and impactful use of emerging AI technologies.

Recognised as both a strategic thinker and hands-on practitioner, I focus on building architectures that are resilient, secure, and future-ready. I’m also passionate about mentoring the next generation of technology leaders through Avanade’s Technology Leadership Career Path programme.
